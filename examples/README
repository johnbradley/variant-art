Last Updated:
Description: A centralized sequence repository for all strains of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) as well as sequences from other members of the Coronaviridae family, roughly 19,500 unique sequences. Metadata for this dataset can be found at s3://sra-pub-cov2-metadata (in progress)

The following diagram describes how data are structured within the S3 bucket s3://sra-pub-sars-cov2/
